<h1>5 Ways To Focus</h1>
<p>I have always had trouble focusing and as such I thought I would take this page to go over my personal strategies to focus...

        <h1>Excersizing</h1>
        <p>If you are hyperactive, like me, then you need to spend some time to work out in the morning so that you expend all of your overflowing evergy. This puts you in a calm state for the rest of the day and it helps you focus on your tasks. Trust me, I know. Sitting at a desk all day is hard. So, take out all of your energy while you get the chance.

        <h1>Coffee</h1>
        <p>This might seem contradictory to the previous recommendation, but coffee is necessary after a morning workout. After a workout, you might feel a bit tired and be looking to take a nap. Don't. Drink some coffee so that you have a bit of energy to keep you going and focused.

        <h1>Ambient Music</h1>
        <p>Listen to some ambient music in the background so that you attention can divert back and forth between the ambient music and the task at hand. My most common issue is that when i need to think about something I tend to step away from my desk. This is where things go awry. You step away for a moment and then you catch yourself knitting an entire sweater. Instead, focus on the music while you think and then go back to work. NO LYRICS.

        <h1>CANDLES!</h1>
        <p>Set a mood and an intention to your focus time through candles. Make your work space a place you want to spend time. Treat yourself to a nice candle and hang somethings up on the wall. You don't want your workspace to be a space you avoid. This should be a spot you always want to come back to. I personally like Malin+Goetz but anything works!

        <h1>Warm Lighting</h1>
        <p>Most places that require focus implement white lighting. This is not conducive to a positive work environment. Your screens already emit so much blue light, that last thing you need is more blue light surrounding your space. This can become overwhelming and might make you feel like you are stuck in a hospital or a library. Instead, replace with bright warm lighting that will make you feel comfortable. Again, Make your space alluring to you.
